## THREESpot (beta)

### A library that allows you to create easily hotspots in 360 degree photos & videos  
[Example](todo)


#### About

The aim of this project is to provide an easy way to integrate interactive spots in 360 WebGL players. The project was tested using non-flat projection.

There is a library called Valiant360 that provides an easy way to make a threejs based player, but the original version did not allow the inclusion of hotspots using this library, so in demo/js folder you can find a modified version that allows it.


#### Usage 

See the [demo folder](https://github.com/stratdi/threespot.js/tree/master/demo) or the [example](todo).  Click and move the mouse to pan the camera, and the scroll wheel to zoom in and out. Click on hotspots to popup a JavaScript alert.
